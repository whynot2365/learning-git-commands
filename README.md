- ## The HTML document structure ##

An HTML document is divided into two parts: _Head part:_ The title and metadata of a web document are contained in the head element. _Body part:_ The body element includes the information that you wish to display on a web page.

1.The `<head>` element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the `<html>` tag and the `<body>` tag. Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

2.The `<body>` tag defines the document's body. The `<body>` element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <P>Hello world</P>
    </body>
</html>
```
- The `<header>` tag 

```html
<header>This is a header tag</header>
```

 The `<header>` HTML tag represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, and other elements, etc.



- The paragraph tag
```html
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```
The `<p>` HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields

- The Heading tag 
```html
<h1>this is a h1 (The largest heading tag) tag</h1>
```
The heading tag is used in HTML to define headings of a page. Headings are defined by `<hn>` , with `“n”` being a number between `1` and `6`, and determines which position a heading has in the hierarchy of the heading structure. Heading tags have a particularly important function within an HTML structure.
